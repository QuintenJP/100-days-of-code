### Day 1: January 4, 2018 ###

**Today's Progress:** Learned the format of freecodecamp.com. Created a Github profile. Worked on declarative coding within salesforce.

**Thoughts:** I am very excited to have found so many resources and the possibility to become part of a professional community.

### Day 2: January 5, 2018 ###

**Today's Progress**: Began to learn CSS (cascading style sheets) via freecodecamp.com and continued declarative skills within salesforce.

**Thoughts**: I am thoroughly enjoying learning how to code. I am short on time and can't elaborate further.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
